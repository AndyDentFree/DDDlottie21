# Lottie

Simple animated vectors from Adobe After Effects via *bodymovin* plugin to JSON, effectively a [standard](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/supported-features) invented in [2015](https://lottiefiles.com/what-is-lottie) with web player.

Fast native players by [AirBnb](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/) 2017 onwards

Visual editors we will be talking about:`<br/>`{=html}[Keyshape](https://www.keyshapeapp.com/), [Flow](https://createwithflow.com/) and [Synfig](https://www.synfig.org/).

# Why does Text Matter?

::: {.left style="float:left;width:20%"}
`<lottie-player 
    src="./assets/11655-hamburger.json"  background="transparent"  speed="1"  style="width: 300px; height: 300px;"  loop autoplay >`{=html}
`</lottie-player>`{=html}
:::

::: {.right style="float:right:width:78%"}
Lottie is text just like SVG`<br/>`{=html}(except JSON rather than \<XML\>)

Easily parsed, hand-edited, `<br />`{=html}& diffed by version control.

# LottieFiles

The [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) site is a (now) commercial marketplace. Apart from providing hosting and sales of many lottie animations, it allows for some simple recolouring.

Let's play with the [Melting Lolly](https://lottiefiles.com/69998-melting-lolly).

# Cavalry

*[Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/) is a brand new procedural application with ambitions to make waves in the worlds of animation, design, creative coding, film, generative art, data visualisation, experiential and advertising.*

Incredibly powerful cross-platform product, worth a serious look but not demo'ing today due lack of time. See [video of Lottie export](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH3x1wtKusU)

```{=html}
<aside class="notes">

Cavalry only popped onto my radar recently, initially had dismissed as being focused on procedural animation. I just didn't have the time to learn another, very powerful tool & not inclined to sign up to pay a subscription to test the Lottie export.
