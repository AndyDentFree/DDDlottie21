# DDDlottie21
Material for my Lottie animation talk at [DDD 2021 conference][ddd] in Perth, Western Australia


## Authoring Tools used
I am using a Markdown approach and based on a [Hacker news thread][hn] decided to try using [markdeck][md] which augments `reveal.js` with a bunch of other goodies. This also embeds the [Lottie Web Player][lottieWeb] enhanced by [Lottie Files][lottiefiles].
