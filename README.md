# DDDlottie21

Material for my Lottie animation talk at [DDD 2021 conference][ddd] in Perth, Western Australia

For UX animation basics see my [DDD 2019 talk on animation][ddd19].

## Authoring Tools used
I am using a Markdown approach using [markdeck][md] which augments `reveal.js` with a bunch of other goodies. This also embeds the [Lottie Web Player][lottieWeb] enhanced by [Lottie Files][lottiefiles].

I first used it in [2019][ddd19].

To have a live site running the slides, so I can show the [Lottie Web Player][lottieWeb] 
use simple server to serve locally via python just `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` which works on either Mac or Windows.
